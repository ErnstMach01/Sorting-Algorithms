 *  Assignment: Selection Sort
 *  Author: Ernst Mach
 *  Date: Saturday February 23th, 2019
 *  Description: A simple program that will sort 15 numbers that have been entered by
 *  the user using the selection sort method. There is a visual component that will
 *  show the user just how the selection sort works and where the sort is at currently.
 *  The user will be able to pause, start, or restart the animation at any point. The
 *  user will also have the option to sort the numbers from increasing order or
 *  decreasing order. Initially the program will sort the numbers in increasing order.
